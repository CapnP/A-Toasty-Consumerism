Some GitHub basics:
* Select a file and click edit for basic text editing!
* These text files use a simple markup language. Press 'm' (when you don't have a textbox selected) for a summary.
* Check out [GitHub for Windows](windows.github.com) for doing anything much beyond text editing.


Style practices:
* ALWAYS include a commit summary, and most of the time a detailed summary of changes.
* COMMIT OFTEN! A git commit should never include over 2 hours of work; especially not for anything experimental.
